# The way this works is the following:
#
# The create-release job runs purely to initialize the GitHub release itself
# and to output upload_url for the following job.
#
# The build-release job runs only once create-release is finished. It gets the
# release upload URL from create-release job outputs, then builds the release
# executables for each supported platform and attaches them as release assets
# to the previously created release.
#
# The key here is that we create the release only once.
